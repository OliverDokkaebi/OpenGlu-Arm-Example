# OpenGlu-Arm-Example
A simple robotic arm example using OpenGL and GLU, developed as a project for the Computer Graphics course at Universidade Federal do Vale do SÃ£o Francisco (UNIVASF). Created by JoÃ£o Victor de Oliveira and Gabriela Mota Lages Gomes.  This project demonstrates basic 3D transformations and hierarchical modeling using C++ and OpenGL.
# OpenGL Robotic Arm (OpenGL + GLU)

This project features a simple articulated robotic arm developed using OpenGL and GLU. It was created as part of the **Computer Graphics** course at the **Universidade Federal do Vale do SÃ£o Francisco (UNIVASF)**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To demonstrate core 3D graphics concepts such as hierarchical modeling and geometric transformations (rotation, translation), using a robotic arm structure composed of connected segments.

## ðŸ‘¥ Authors

- JoÃ£o Victor de Oliveira  
- Gabriela Mota Lages Gomes

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- C++
- OpenGL
- GLU (OpenGL Utility Library)
- FreeGLUT (for window management and input)
- JavaScript

## ðŸš€ How to Compile and Run

### âœ… Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- OpenGL and FreeGLUT libraries
- Properly set up `include` and `lib` directories (as provided or configured)

### ðŸ’» Compilation Command (Windows â€“ MinGW or similar)

Assuming you have an `include/` folder with headers and `lib/x64/` folder with `.lib` files:

```bash
g++ -o main.exe main.cpp -I"./include" -L"./lib/x64" -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32
